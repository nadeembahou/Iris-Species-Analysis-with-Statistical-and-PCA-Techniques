# Iris-Species-Analysis-with-Statistical-and-PCA-Techniques

Project Overview
This project analyzes the Iris dataset, focusing on understanding the relationships between different flower features and species. It includes various data processing techniques and visualizations.

Contents
Data Analysis: Statistical analysis of the Iris dataset by feature and species, with results displayed in structured tables.

Data Visualization: Visualization of feature combinations using Seaborn to illustrate relationships between features and species.

Sorting Algorithm: Custom implementation of a sorting algorithm for the dataset features, including a running time analysis.

Data Normalization: An algorithm to normalize the dataset, scaling feature values to a range of 0 to 1.

Outlier Removal: An algorithm to identify and remove outliers based on their distance from the class mean, along with a running time analysis.

Feature Ranking: A ranking algorithm to determine the significance of each feature in separating species, with running time analysis.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA applied to analyze variance in the dataset, comparing results across all species and individually by species.

Expected Outcomes
Enhanced understanding of the Iris dataset and its features.
Visual representations that clarify feature relationships.
Identification of significant features and outliers.
Insights into data distribution and variance through PCA.
Usage
Run the provided Python scripts in a suitable environment with the necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to perform the analyses and visualizations as outlined.
